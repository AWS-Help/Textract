Enterprise Document Intelligence: AI Review Board Flow

Objective: Securely process unstructured financial documents with auditable, high-precision data extraction to reduce manual review time and ensure compliance.

High-Level Process Overview

This pipeline operates in five distinct, auditable phases, separating the tasks of ingestion, classification, logic, and extraction.

Key Governance / Safety Check

1. Ingestion & Triage

Converts the raw PDF into machine-readable text blocks (OCR). Scans the page for structural elements (e.g., tables, charts).

Data Lineage: Full trace from raw document to initial data blocks. Data Security: Processing occurs within a secure, private cloud perimeter.

2. Classification & Indexing

Mathematically classifies every page based on vector similarity to a library of pre-approved semantic phrases/keywords (categories.json). The text is indexed into the RAG database.

Sentence-Transformers, OpenSearch (k-NN)

Deterministic Classification: Based on a mathematical vector score, ensuring predictability and no LLM interpretation of document type.

3. Intelligent Segmentation

Uses LangGraph to apply rule-based segmentation. It monitors pre-defined Business Key changes (e.g., Lender Name) to create auditable, legally distinct document segments.

Auditable Rules: Segmentation boundaries are based on explicit policy (Phase 3 logic), not arbitrary AI decisions. Control Plane: LangGraph acts as the central workflow manager.

4. Fact Extraction & Validation

Runs Hybrid Search to retrieve only evidence chunks. Gemini 2.5 Flash fills a pre-defined JSON schema (automated_entities.json) using only this verified context.

Constrained LLM: LLM is a "Structured Data Parser" for a fixed schema, not a generative writer. HITL Gateway: Low-confidence extractions are automatically flagged for mandatory human review.

5. Synthesis & Reporting

Generates a concise summary by fusing structured facts with original context. Final output is indexed with full citation links.

Full Audit Trail: Final data includes direct citation links (page number/chunk ID) for every fact, making the entire process verifiable.

Key Governance Takeaways for the Board (Short Version)

1. Controlled LLM Use

No Free Writing: The LLM's role is strictly limited to filling a fixed JSON schema or consolidating conflicting values.

No Full Document Access: The LLM never receives the complete document. It only receives verified context chunks retrieved from our internal RAG index.

Secure Gateway: All LLM communication is routed through a secure GenAI Gateway for auditing and rate control.

2. Safety and Predictability

Deterministic Classification: Document type is determined by a mathematical vector score, ensuring predictability and auditability, independent of the LLM.

Policy-Driven Logic: Segmentation (Phase 3) is based on pre-defined business rules (e.g., a change in BorrowerName), not arbitrary AI logic.

Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): A quantitative confidence score flags uncertain extractions for mandatory human oversight.
